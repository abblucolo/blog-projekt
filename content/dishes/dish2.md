Overwatch is a game about getting absolutely shit on by smurfs in every rank and then uninstalling, except now you're addicted and come back just to suffer through endless shitty games until finally you never turn your computer on again just to avoid the pain and suffering of this hellish game. Described as a "hero shooter", Overwatch assigns players into two teams of six, with each player selecting from a large roster of characters, known as "heroes", with unique abilities.

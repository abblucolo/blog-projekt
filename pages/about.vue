        <p>
            My name is Lucas Olofsson and I'm a student of ABB-Gymnasiet from Sweden trying to start my own blog.
            Currently I'm studying programming and other tech-related subjects in school.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-sky">How the blog started</h2>
        <p>
            The blog is a project that I've only started recently after learning about web development in school.
            After many lessons in the subject, we were finally tasked with creating a website. That is when I started creating this blog.
            My aim with this blog is to learn more about both blogging and web development in order to further develop my knowledge within the area.
            Since the subject is very important for my studies, it is also a big interest of mine.
            Computers and technology in general has always been an interest of mine, but I've only recently picked up programming since I didn't know much about it before starting it at school.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-sky">Why LucasBlog?</h2>
        <p class="mb-5">
            This blog doesn't have a target audience and is meant to appeal to everyone who happens to stumble upon it.
            Initially, the plan was to primarily write about my experience learning about programming and how it is like to study at ABB-Gymnasiet.
            However, I ultimately decided that it would be more interesting not only for me, but for the audience as well if I were to include a wider array of different themes and subjects to write about.
            In simpler terms; my aim is to reach a wide audience and to hopefully entertain them as best as possible.
